Dan is an avid tech enthusiast. He grew up in the 90s reading science fiction novels
and geeking out over technology, picturing a world where, by 2025, we’d have flying cars,
AI companions, smart cities, and seamless human-machine integration.

Instead, he finds himself in a world where smart devices struggle to understand basic commands,
phones are bombarded with endless notifications, and spam emails flood his inbox.
Rather than a sleek, efficient future, he’s surrounded by glitchy gadgets and constant digital noise.

One day, on his way home from work, he hears about a technology company called EVERYTHING
that claims to have finally realized the futuristic vision he’d always dreamed of.
They boast about having developed advanced AI that truly understands human needs,
featuring autonomous agents that can proactively take action on their own.
By tapping into device data, these agents can act on users’ behalf, surface timely and accurate recommendations,
and even curate personalized entertainment experiences in a timely, non-intrusive way.
Dan is captivated by the idea of living in a world where technology not only responds to commands but also
foresees his needs and acts independently to improve his daily life.

Intrigued and skeptical, he decides to learn more, hoping that EVERYTHING might finally
deliver on the promise of a seamless, intelligent future.
